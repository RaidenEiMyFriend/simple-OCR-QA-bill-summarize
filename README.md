# OCR & QA System

## Overview
This project combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Question Answering (QA) capabilities to extract text from images (bills) and answer user queries based on the extracted content. The system utilizes:
- **EasyOCR** for text extraction from images.
- **FAISS** for efficient document embedding and retrieval.
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for natural language processing.
- **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface.

## Features
- Upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and extract text automatically.
- Store extracted text in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
- Ask questions related to the extracted text and get meaningful answers.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Streamlit UI:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

## Dependencies
- `streamlit`
- `opencv-python`
- `easyocr`
- `langchain`
- `faiss-cpu`
- `transformers`

## Demo
For example, i have this bill for my shopping:
![Image](results/temp.jpg)
When i drag the file to the app, it generates texts based on the bill like this:
![Text](results/image2.png)
If i want to ask something about the bill, it will be like this:
![Asking](results/image1.png)
